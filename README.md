Sooo.. I'm a 17 year old highschool student in Coimbatore, TN, India.
I like making philosophy, and music, and philosophical music. So here's a channel made for it that contains everything but that : www.youtube.com/c/xetcentera
My git repos contain some codes I made as learning projects, or to assist me in making stuff for thar channel.

Iâ€™m currently learning bash and powershell scripting, Py, JS, C, the art of finding vulnerabilities, UX and UI, Video editing, Music and Astronomy, by myself for seemingly no reason..

I'll be happy to collaborate on projects that involve one or more of those.
